To run this app:

  cd the the folder

  run the server in the terminal:
    python3 server.py    |    python interceptor.py

  run the exploit in an adjacent terminal:
    python3 interceptor.py    |    python interceptor.py

You can then connect as many devices that are on the same network at the given localhost url and seamlessly chat with each other.

However, the interceptor knows the port which you will be communicating through!! Make sure to toggle encryption so they can't "listen" to your conversation.
